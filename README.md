PROJECT TITLE
GROCERY STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
ABSTRACT

The Grocery Store Management System is a simple console-based application developed in the C programming language.
The main objective of this project is to manage grocery store inventory efficiently by providing basic operations such as adding items, displaying all items, and updating item quantities.

This program uses structures and arrays to store the details of grocery items such as Item ID, Name, Quantity, and Price. It supports up to 10 items and uses menu-driven interaction for user-friendly operation.

This project demonstrates key concepts of C including structures, arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions. It is ideal for beginners who want to develop practical applications using C programming.
